- RESTful API design

## Technologies and Tools Used

- Nodemon for hot reloading during development
- dotenv for environment variable management

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed (v14 or higher recommended)
- MongoDB installed and running on default port (27017)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd se_project_express
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Create an `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
```
PORT=3001
DB_ADDRESS=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/wtwr_db
```
